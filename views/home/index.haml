              %b Our services help find the perfect franchise for YOU.
            %p Now that you have made the decision to become the proprietor of your own business through franchising, the next step is the most important one: Choosing the right franchise.
            %p There are tens of thousands of franchises available. How do you pick the right one for you?
            %p Once you have narrowed down your field of interest, selecting a franchise is a process that involves asking many questions, and examining the advantages versus the disadvantages among similar franchising options. 
            %p All franchisors have media kits that are visually stunning and enticing so that they can present the advantages of their product, but how do you know if they have a strong and reliable business structure and workable system of organization? Choosing a franchise involves proper research and a careful analysis of statistics, company background, business structure and company regulations.
            %p Franchise Resource Group has decades of experience in the franchising industry, and we fully assist and guide you in making an informed and secure decision that is backed up by real research. FRG has evaluated thousands of available and popular franchises currently on the market, and we have hand-selected every single franchise that is in our portfolio&mdash;that is not something that many other franchising consulting companies can say. 
            %p We have over 350 franchises in our portfolio, and we have selected them based on long-range, successful performance criteria so that you can be certain that your investment is secure. We pride ourselves on staying current, and we are always evaluating new franchises and emerging trends on the market.

            %p Franchise Resource Group is not an agent, employee, representative, or other functionary of the seller of the respective franchises introduced to you. Franchise Resource Group is an Independent Contractor, engaged in the activity of introducing prospective business buyers to sellers of franchises. Franchise Resource Group has not checked the accuracy of the written or web site information provided by the seller, and assumes no responsibility for the acts, errors, or omissions of the seller, or the outcome of any transaction.
            %p Franchise Resource Group is not qualified to advise in any part of the purchase of a franchise. You are urged to seek professional advice from a lawyer, accountant, or other qualified resource.
            %p Many Franchisors disclose various earnings claims in their disclosure documents. Franchise Resource Group does not enter into discussions of earnings claims. Any earning claims information shall come directly from the franchise representatives.
            %p Buying a franchise is a complicated investment. Take your time to decide, and personally visit the headquarters of the company you elect to buy from. Make good, common sense decisions in all investment matters.
            %p 
              The Federal Trade Commission regulates the sale of franchises. The FTC has a very user friendly web site, www.FTC.gov. We suggest you use it. Your state may also have laws regarding franchises. Ask your state consumer affairs agencies about them. The
              %a{:href => "http://www.bbb.org", :target => "_blank"} Better Business Bureau
              is another excellent information source for potential franchise buyers. www.BBB.com will put you in instant touch with both local and national offices.
            %p You alone are responsible for researching the franchise you purchase.
